Hangman Game

Overview
Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. The game ends either when the player guesses the word correctly or when they run out of allowed guesses.

Features
Guess the hidden word by entering letters.
Tracks incorrect guesses and displays a visual representation of the hangman.
Provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.

How It Works
Word Selection: The game selects a random word from a predefined list of words.
Game Loop: The game uses a for loop to iterate through allowed guesses and a while loop to continue the game until it is won or lost.
Guess Handling: The game checks each guessed letter using if/else statements to determine if it's correct or incorrect.
State Tracking: It updates the display of the hidden word and the number of remaining guesses.
Game Modules: Utilizes Python standard libraries for random word selection and input handling.
